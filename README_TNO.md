Landuse Tools - Application to TNO cases
========================================
_L. Geers, Feb 2023_

Next to the Eindhoven domain, there is also the definition of a Veluwe domain as a base case for simulations
of the deposition from a single highway (A50) on grassland/forest. This is to be compared with a purely
academic case also defined on this domain, where the highway is a straight line and deposition takes place on
either grassland (top half) or forest (bottom half of the domain).

The starting point was chosen to be Ede Zuid (**lat, lon = 52.02452, 5.66403, 
x, y = 174000,
448500** to **lat, lon = 52.11335, 5.95657, x, y = 194000, 458500**). The 
domain 
size is 20 km by 10 km with 50 x 50 m 
cells.

In additon, a small domain has been selected of 8 x 4 km with 50 x 50 m 
cells starting at **186000, 448500
(52.09627, 5.72285)** and ending at **194000, 452500 (52.05943, 5.95588)**.
